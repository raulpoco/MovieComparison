<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The project was built to practice some JavaScript concepts, such as Data Structers, DOM manipulation, the use of API's and a promise-based HTTP Client, AXIOS, using lines of code in a more efficient way and understanding the notions of design patterns and many other things.
This project was created thanks to the course, but also to my ambition to know and use the APIs, to use Axios, to use the array methods to extract and compare each individual filmI think this project helped me a lot

Here's why:

* I learned new concepts related to Promises, APi's. Their extraction and processing
* I understood the importance of using a reusable code (autocomplete widget and debounce). It can be reused in other projects
* The most interesting thing was the rendering of HTML elements from JS, with the help of some functions at the time of an action performed by the user :smile:
* The use of some CSS frameworks to make styles more efficient and easy to use



This project is used only for the purpose of theoretical and practical training for deepening the notions and concepts related to JavaScript.


### Built With

The application was built with the help of a framework:

Bulma is a **modern CSS framework** based on [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The application can be deployed to be used or tested locally

### Prerequisites

A keyboard and a laptop/pc is required for the game to be functional.

The keys used in the game are W, A, S, D and up arrow, down arrow, right arrow and left arrow



### Installation

To use the API's . Read the documentation from http://www.omdbapi.com/ .
